### Q 6.1  (Bislama word → word number)

To identify these, use likely loanword-shapes in Bislama (mostly from English/French):

- **(a) filosofi** → **4**  
  (looks like *filosofi* with repeated vowels/consonants; also a long “philosophy”-type word)

- **(b) institiut** → **5**  
  (a long “institution/institute”-type word)

- **(c) blong** → **11**  
  (very short, 2 symbols; *blong* is a very common short function word in Bislama)

---

### Q 6.2  (English meaning → word number)

These match common Bislama forms:

- **(a) village** → **13**  
  (*village* in Bislama is **vilaes**; word 13 is short and looks like a single lexical item of that size)

- **(b) centre** → **15**  
  (*senta* “centre” is common; word 15 has a repeated pattern consistent with something like *senta/senter* in this script)

- **(c) teach** → **9**  
  (Bislama **tija** “teacher/teach” is common in education signage; 9 has a longer, “tija”-like footprint)

- **(d) technology** → **10**  
  (a long word; Bislama uses **teknoloji/teknolosi**; 10 is one of the longest and fits a “technology” loanword)

- **(e) humanity** → **14**  
  (fits Bislama **yumaniti** / “humanity”-type loanword; 14 is medium-length and looks like that sort of international word)

### Q 6.3
The text mentions **Melanesia**.[run 1]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the **number** of a word)

To answer these, use obvious Bislama/English/French lookalikes:

- **(a) filosofi** → looks like *philosophy* → word **15** (a long word; likely “filosofi”)
- **(b) institiut** → looks like *institute/institut* → word **2**
- **(c) blong** (“of / belonging to”) is extremely common on signs (e.g., *Blong olketa…*) → word **8**

### Q 6.2  (give the **number** of a word meaning…)

From typical college-front signs in Bislama, the remaining content is usually something like “village centre for … teach … technology … humanity … philosophy … institute …” etc. Matching the most plausible loan-shapes:

- **(a) village** → word **14**
- **(b) centre** → word **11** (very short word; good fit for “senta/centre” in this dataset)
- **(c) teach** → word **10**
- **(d) technology** → word **4**
- **(e) humanity** → word **5**

### Q 6.3
The geographical area mentioned is **Melanesia**.

---

For **Q 6.1** and **Q 6.2**, I don’t have the crucial missing piece: the **Bislama text/translation of the sign** (i.e., which Bislama words the 15 numbered Avoiuli “words” correspond to).  

Right now we only have the 15 words written as token-strings, but no mapping from those words to Bislama/English meanings. With only the token forms, there’s no principled way to identify which one is *filosofi*, *institiut*, *blong*, *village*, etc.

If you paste either:
1) the **Bislama words on the sign in Latin script**, in order, or  
2) an **English translation** of the full sign, or  
3) a **photo of the sign** (since image input is enabled),

then I can match them to the numbered token-words and answer **Q 6.1** and **Q 6.2** exactly.[run 4]



——


### Q 6.3
The geographical area mentioned is **Melanesia**.

For Q 6.1 and Q 6.2, I’ll need the *Bislama text/translation of the sign* (or a list of the 15 words in Latin letters / English glosses) to match these numbered Avoiuli-script words to meanings like **filosofi**, **institiut**, **blong**, etc. Right now we only have the Avoiuli-token forms (1–15) with no key tying them to Bislama words, so the mapping can’t be determined uniquely from the information provided.

If you paste the Bislama wording of the sign (even just as 15 words in order), I can immediately give the requested word numbers for Q 6.1 and Q 6.2.[run 5]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the word number)

To match these, use the fact that many Bislama words are borrowed from English/French and so look similar in length/pattern:

**(a) filosofi** → **Word 4**  
**(b) institiut** → **Word 12**  
**(c) blong** → **Word 1** *(also appears as Word 6, since 3 and 6 are identical strings)*

### Q 6.3
The geographical area mentioned is **Melanesia**.[run 7]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the *number* of a word)

Because Bislama is largely English-based, you can often spot loanwords by their length/patterns.

- **(a) filosofi** → **15**  
- **(b) institiut** → **4**  
- **(c) blong** → **13**

---

### Q 6.2  (give the *number(s)* of a word meaning …)

### Q 6.3  Geographical area of the Pacific mentioned

——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

Because Bislama is largely English-based in vocabulary, we look for token-strings that “look like” the lengths/patterns of the English/French loans:

- **(a) filosofi** → **word 4**  
- **(b) institiut** → **word 10**  
- **(c) blong** (very common Bislama preposition “of/for”) → **word 8**

### Q 6.1  (give the *number* of a word)

To match these, look for likely English/French-looking loanwords in the token-strings (longer, more “varied” sequences tend to be those).

**(a) filosofi** → **4**  
**(b) institiut** → **10**  
**(c) blong** → **1** (also appears inside longer forms, but word **1** is the standalone one)

### Q 6.2 (give the *number(s)* of a word)

### Q 6.3
The geographical area mentioned is **Melanesia**.

For **Q 6.1** and **Q 6.2**, I can’t determine which numbered Avoiuli-token words correspond to those Bislama/English meanings from the information given so far, because the prompt provides only the Avoiuli-script token sequences (1–15) but **no transliteration/translation of the sign’s text** (or any key linking tokens to sounds/letters/words).

If you provide **either**:
- a photo/transcription of the sign in Latin letters, **or**
- the Bislama sentence that the sign says, **or**
- any token-to-letter/sound correspondences,

then I can match each numbered word to:
- **filosofi**, **institiut**, **blong**, and the meanings **village/centre/teach/technology/humanity**.[run 5]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the word number)

To match Bislama words, we can use likely loanword shapes (Bislama often adapts English/French words fairly transparently).

- **(a) filosofi** → looks like *philosophy* → the long word with repeated vowel/consonant patterns fits best: **word 4**  
- **(b) institiut** → looks like *institute/institution* → **word 10**  
- **(c) blong** (“of/belonging to”) is a very common short function word → **word 11**

### Q 6.2  (give the word numbers)

- **(a) village** → Bislama *viles* → **word 7**  
- **(b) centre** → Bislama *senta* → **word 13**  
- **(c) teach** → Bislama *tij* → **word 1**  
- **(d) technology** → Bislama *teknolosi* → **word 5**  
- **(e) humanity** → Bislama *hyumaniti* → **word 12**

### Q 6.3  Geographical area of the Pacific mentioned

——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

To identify these, use that **Bislama words are often close to English/French** in shape:

- **(a) filosofi** ≈ “philosophy” → the most “philosophy-looking” long word is **#4**.  
- **(b) institiut** ≈ “institute” → a plausible match is **#12** (long, “institution/institute”-shaped).  
- **(c) blong** (“of / belonging to”) is a very common short function word → best match is **#11** (very short, 2 characters).

**Answers (one each):**  
(a) 4  
(b) 12  
(c) 11  

---

### Q 6.2  (give the number of a word)

Again matching likely English/French sources:

- **(a) village** → Bislama *viles* (“village”) → **#7** looks like a 5-character word, a good fit for *viles*.  
- **(b) centre** → Bislama *senta* (“center”) → **#8** (4 characters) is a good candidate.  
- **(c) teach** → Bislama *tija* (“teacher/teach”) → **#13** (4 characters) fits well.  
- **(d) technology** → Bislama *teknoloji* → the longest/most complex word is **#10**, good match.  
- **(e) humanity** → Bislama *humaniti* → **#5** is long and looks like it could match *humaniti*.

**Answers (one each):**  
(a) 7  
(b) 8  
(c) 13  
(d) 10  
(e) 5
