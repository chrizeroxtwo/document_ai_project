### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

To spot these, use that Bislama borrows many words directly from English/French-looking forms:

- **(a) filosofi** → looks like “philosophy”; the best match is the long word with repeated patterns typical of *filosofi*: **word 12**  
- **(b) institiut** → looks like “institute/institution”; the best match is the long, very “technical-looking” word: **word 10**  
- **(c) blong** → extremely common short Bislama function word (“of/for/belonging to”); likely a short 2‑symbol word: **word 11**

### Q 6.2  (give the numbers of a word)

- **(a) village** → in Bislama this is **vilaes**; best match among the remaining content words: **word 7**
- **(b) centre** → in Bislama commonly **senta**; best match: **word 8**
- **(c) teach** → in Bislama **tija/tiij** (“teacher/teach” forms); best match: **word 13**
- **(d) technology** → looks like “teknoloji”; best match: **word 9**
- **(e) humanity** → looks like “humaniti”; best match: **word 15**

### Q 6.3
The text mentions the Pacific region of **Melanesia**.[run 1]



——


### Step 1: Use repeated words to spot **blong**
Word **3** and word **6** are identical:

- 3. `<token_3><token_7><token_8><token_9>`
- 6. `<token_3><token_7><token_8><token_9>`

In Bislama signage (especially for institutions), the word **“blong”** (“of / belonging to”) commonly appears more than once in a formal name, so the repeated word is a very strong candidate for **blong**.

So:
- **blong = word 3 (or 6)**

---

## Q 6.1  (give a word number)

(a) **filosofi**  
Avoiuli here is writing Bislama words that often resemble English/French. The word that looks longest/most “technical” is a good candidate for *filosofi* or *institiut*.  
A strong fit for **filosofi** is **word 12** (long, complex, looks like a content word rather than a short function word):

- **filosofi = 12**

(b) **institiut**  
A good candidate for “institution/institute” is another prominent long word used in school names; **word 4** is long and structured like a major noun in a title:

- **institiut = 4**

(c) **blong**  
As argued from repetition:

- **blong = 3** (also acceptable: **6**)

---

## Q 6.2  (give word numbers)

Here we use likely semantics of a college sign: it will typically mention something like **village**, **centre**, **teach**, **technology**, **humanity**. The best anchors we have are:
- **blong** already identified as **3/6**
- the remaining content words should be among the longer, non-repeated items.

A consistent assignment (any one if multiple) is:

(a) **village** = **13**  
(b) **centre** = **8**  
(c) **teach** = **10**  
(d) **technology** = **11**  
(e) **humanity** = **15**

## Q 6.3
The text explicitly says Vanuatu is in the Pacific region of **Melanesia**.

**Answer: Melanesia**[run 2]



——


### Q 6.1
Match repeated words first: word **3** and word **6** are identical, so they likely correspond to a common Bislama function word that appears twice in a sign. **“blong”** (“of / belonging to”) is extremely common in institutional names, so:

- **(c) blong** → **3** (or **6**)

Now look for likely loanwords.

**“institiut”** is “institute”, likely a relatively long word (many letters), and in Bislama signage it often appears as **institut**. The longest/most “institution-like” single word here is **4** (9 tokens), which fits well as a major noun like “institute”.

- **(b) institiut** → **4**

**“filosofi”** (“philosophy”) is also a long-ish academic term; among the remaining candidates, **5** is the longest (10 tokens) and looks like another major academic noun phrase component. So:

- **(a) filosofi** → **5**

### Q 6.2
Using the same idea (common Bislama terms on an educational sign):

- **(a) village** → **13**  
- **(b) centre** → **8**  
- **(c) teach** → **12**  
- **(d) technology** → **10**  
- **(e) humanity** → **15**

### Q 6.3
The passage explicitly says Vanuatu is in “the Pacific region of **Melanesia**”.

- **Melanesia**[run 3]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

We look for obvious English/French cognates in the repeated word list.

- **(a) filosofi** → **word 10**  
  (long word; looks like it could match “filosofi / philosophy”)

- **(b) institiut** → **word 4**  
  (very long, “institution/institute”-shaped word; also has repeated patterns typical of *institiut*)

- **(c) blong** → **word 11**  
  (very short common function word; *blong* is extremely frequent in Bislama and is typically short on signs)

---

### Q 6.2  (give the numbers of a word)

These are standard terms you’d expect on an educational sign (college / centre / technology etc.). Matching likely cognates:

- **(a) village** → **word 13**  
- **(b) centre** → **word 8**  
- **(c) teach** → **word 12**  
- **(d) technology** → **word 15**  
- **(e) humanity** → **word 10**

### Q 6.3  Geographical area mentioned

**Melanesia**.[run 4]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

We look for Bislama words that are clearly borrowed from English/French and will likely appear as longer “academic” words in the sign.

- **(a) filosofi** → **word 15**  
- **(b) institiut** → **word 10**  
- **(c) blong** → **word 1**

---

### Q 6.2  (give the number(s) of a word meaning …)

- **(a) village** → **word 13**  
- **(b) centre** → **word 8**  
- **(c) teach** → **word 14**  
- **(d) technology** → **word 12**  
- **(e) humanity** → **word 7**

### Q 6.3  Which geographical area of the Pacific is mentioned?

**Melanesia**[run 5]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

To solve these, match obvious English/French-derived Bislama words by repeated patterns:

- **(a) filosofi** → **word 5**  
- **(b) institiut** → **word 4**  
- **(c) blong** → **word 1**

---

### Q 6.2  (give the number(s) of a word meaning …)

Using common Bislama vocabulary that typically appears on institution signs:

- **(a) village** → **word 8**  
- **(b) centre** → **word 2**  
- **(c) teach** → **word 12**  
- **(d) technology** → **word 10**  
- **(e) humanity** → **word 15**

---

### Q 6.3  Geographical area of the Pacific mentioned

**Melanesia**.[run 6]



——


### Q 6.1  (give a word number)

We can spot likely loanwords from English/French by repeated patterns:

- **institiut** ≈ “institute/institution” → looks like word **10** (a long word with repeated internal patterning typical of *institut*).
- **blong** (“belong/of”, very common Bislama function word) → likely a short, very frequent word; word **11** is the only 2-token word, so that best matches **blong**.
- **filosofi** (“philosophy”) → another long loanword; word **15** fits well as a long content word distinct from the others.

**Answers (any one if multiple):**
- (a) *filosofi* → **15**
- (b) *institiut* → **10**
- (c) *blong* → **11**

---

### Q 6.2  (give the word number)

From the set, there are some clear repeats and some words that look like institution/education terms. Using likely Bislama vocabulary expected on a college sign (things like “village”, “centre”, “teach”, “technology”, “humanity”) and matching by plausibility/word-shape:

- **village** (often *vilej*) → looks like a medium-length loanword; best match **7**.
- **centre** (*senta*) → best match **8**.
- **teach** (*tija* / *tij*) → best match **13**.
- **technology** (*teknoloji*) → long, complex loanword; best match **12**.
- **humanity** (*yumaniti*) → long loanword; best match **5**.

**Answers:**
- (a) village → **7**
- (b) centre → **8**
- (c) teach → **13**
- (d) technology → **12**
- (e) humanity → **5**

---

### Q 6.3
The geographical area mentioned is **Melanesia**.[run 7]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

To solve these, note that several items are clear Bislama borrowings from English:

- **blong** (“of / belonging to”) is extremely common in Bislama and looks like it would plausibly be a short high‑frequency word; in the list the best match is **word 11** (only two tokens).
- **institiut** (≈ “institute”) is likely a longer word and appears to match the overall “college/institution sign” context; **word 4** is a long, institution-like form.
- **filosofi** (≈ “philosophy”) is also a long academic word; **word 5** is another long academic-looking item.

So:

**(a) filosofi:** 5  
**(b) institiut:** 4  
**(c) blong:** 11  

---

### Q 6.2  (give the number(s) of a word meaning…)

Some words repeat: word **3** and **6** are identical, so they likely correspond to a meaningful repeated term in the sign (often “technology”, “centre”, “humanity”, etc. in institutional names). Also, a very common structure on such signs is like “_____ Centre / Institute of _____”.

Using likely Bislama forms:

- **village** in Bislama is commonly *viles*; a medium-length word fits: **word 1** (3 tokens) is a good candidate for a short noun like that.
- **centre** in Bislama is *senta*; a repeated formal word on a sign is plausible—**word 3/6** (same word repeated) fits well for something like “centre”.
- **teach** in Bislama is *tij* or *tija* (teach/teacher); a shorter mid-length word fits: **word 8**.
- **technology** in Bislama is *teknoloji*; that’s long and technical: **word 10** is long and looks like a “big borrowed” term.
- **humanity** could correspond to *humaniti* (also a borrowing); another long academic term: **word 12** or **15** would fit best—here **word 15** is a long abstract-looking one suitable for a field/discipline.

Answers:

**(a) village:** 1  
**(b) centre:** 3 (also 6)  
**(c) teach:** 8  
**(d) technology:** 10  
**(e) humanity:** 15

### Q 6.3  Which geographical area of the Pacific is mentioned?

**Melanesia**.[run 8]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the *number* of a word)

To spot these, note that **word 3 and word 6 are identical**, so they are almost certainly a common function word. In Bislama, the very common preposition/particle is **blong** (“of/from/belonging to”), which typically appears many times on signs.

- **(a) filosofi** → **15**  
- **(b) institiut** → **12**  
- **(c) blong** → **3** (also **6**)

---

### Q 6.2  (give the *number(s)* of a word meaning …)

Using likely campus-sign vocabulary and repetition patterns:

- **(a) village** → **13**  
- **(b) centre** → **8**  
- **(c) teach** → **10**  
- **(d) technology** → **7**  
- **(e) humanity** → **14**
