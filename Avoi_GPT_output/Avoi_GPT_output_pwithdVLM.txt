### Q 6.1  (give a word number)

To identify these, use that Bislama borrows heavily from English/French in spelling:

- **(a) filosofi** ≈ “philosophy” → looks like a longer European loanword: **word 12**  
- **(b) institiut** ≈ “institute” → also a long loanword: **word 10**  
- **(c) blong** (very common Bislama preposition/marker “of/for/belonging to”) → likely one of the short high-frequency words: **word 11**

### Q 6.2  (give a word number)

- **(a) village** → **word 13**  
- **(b) centre** → **word 8**  
- **(c) teach** → **word 4**

### Q 6.3

### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

Because Bislama uses many English/French-derived words, we can often spot repeated “function words” and likely loanwords by where they appear and how often they repeat.

**(a) filosofi** → **15**  
**(b) institiut** → **10**  
**(c) blong** → **3** (also appears as **6**, same word repeated)

### Q 6.3  Geographical area of the Pacific mentioned

——


### Q 6.1  (give the word number)

To find these, use the fact that Bislama borrows many such words almost directly from English/French spelling:

- **(a) filosofi** → looks like “philosophy” → **word 10**  
- **(b) institiut** → “institute” → **word 12**  
- **(c) blong** (very common Bislama preposition “of/for/belonging to”) → short, frequent-looking connector word → **word 11**

### Q 6.3

The geographical area of the Pacific mentioned is **Melanesia**.[run 4]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the number of a word)

To answer this, we look for likely Bislama borrowings:

- **blong** (“of / belonging to”) is one of the most common Bislama function words, so it will likely be a **short, frequent** word appearing in the sign. The only exact repeated word on the sign is **word 3 = word 6**, so that is very likely **blong**.

- **institiut** and **filosofi** are longer “academic” loanwords, so they are likely among the longer items that appear once.

Answers (one possible set):
- (a) **filosofi** → **15**
- (b) **institiut** → **12**
- (c) **blong** → **3** (also **6**, since word 6 is identical)

---

### Q 6.2  (give the number of a word)

Using the same logic (longer technical terms tend to be longer words; common concrete nouns and verbs tend to be medium length):

- (a) **village** → **13**
- (b) **centre** → **8**
- (c) **teach** → **7**
- (d) **technology** → **10**
- (e) **humanity** → **5**

### Q 6.3  Which geographical area of the Pacific is mentioned?

**Melanesia**[run 7]



——


### Q 6.1  (give the word number)

A key clue is that **word 3 and word 6 are identical**, and in Bislama a very common repeated word on signs is **blong** (“of / belonging to”). So:

- **(c) blong** → **3** (also **6**)

Now look for likely loanwords from English/French:

- **institiut** (≈ “institute”) is long and “Latin/English-looking”; the best match among the remaining long, formal-looking words on an institutional sign is **word 4**.
- **filosofi** (≈ “philosophy”) is also a formal subject word; the best match is **word 5**.

So:
- **(a) filosofi** → **5**  
- **(b) institiut** → **4**  
- **(c) blong** → **3** (or **6**)

### Q 6.2  (give the word number)

- **technology** → **10**
- **humanity** → **15**
