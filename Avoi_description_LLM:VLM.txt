| Token | Description |
|------|-------------|
| token_token_token_1 | The symbol is a centered, symmetrical black inverted-V/arrowhead shape with slightly inward-curving sides, tapered toward a narrow peak and a soft blurred edge. |
| token_token_token_2 | The symbol is three connected loop forms: two equal overlapping lower circles joined by a thick central vertical stroke, topped by a larger tilted semicircular loop. |
| token_token_token_3 | The symbol is a bold, continuous-line heart outline with a pointed bottom and a small overlap/intersection at the lower center. |
| token_token_token_4 | The symbol is a central tilted oval with two parallel horizontal strokes beneath it that meet upward into a triangular connection, resembling an eye with a V-like base. |
| token_token_token_5 | The symbol is a symmetric heart-like geometric form made from two converging vertical strokes above paired side triangles, ending in a small diamond at the bottom center. |
| token_token_token_6 | The symbol is a thick, smooth, symmetrical arch (inverted U) with uniform stroke weight and no internal markings. |
| token_token_token_7 | The symbol is a thick, symmetrical arch frame with a slightly blurred/gradient edge and a lightly speckled texture around the white interior boundary. |
| token_token_token_8 | The symbol is a symmetrical figure with two vertical oval loops above and a crisscross X-shaped set of thick intersecting lines connecting them at the bottom. |
| token_token_token_9 | The symbol is a bold symmetric triangular framework with a small inverted triangle at the top, a central vertical stroke, and two large circles inside the lower triangular area. |
| token_token_token_10 | The symbol is a minimalist cross/plus made of four thick straight lines intersecting at a central point, forming four triangular sectors. |
| token_token_token_11 | The symbol resembles a bold ampersand-like form with a central vertical stroke, a mid horizontal bar, and two mirrored open loops crossing around the center. |
| token_token_token_12 | The symbol is an elongated ampersand-like figure with two intersecting loops (upper larger, lower smaller) linked by a short central horizontal stroke. |
| token_token_token_13 | The symbol is a symmetrical abstract butterfly/star made of intersecting curved and diagonal lines around a central V/triangular core with a looped open lower section. |
| token_token_token_14 | The symbol is two intersecting vertical oval loops forming a butterfly-like top, connected to two straight lines that converge downward into a V shape. |
| token_token_token_15 | The symbol is a cross-like structure of three thick horizontal bars intersected by two thinner vertical strokes, forming two stacked oval-shaped enclosed spaces. |
| token_token_token_16 | The symbol is a stylized cross with a central horizontal bar, two large symmetrical semicircular loops above and below, and a diagonal vertical stroke intersecting the center. |
| token_token_token_17 | The symbol is two overlapping semicircular outlines crossed by a thick central horizontal line, giving a rough hand-drawn looped appearance. |
| token_token_token_18 | The symbol is an abstract “head” circle with two symmetric side circles and a downward stem that splits into two lines forming an X-shaped base. |
| token_token_token_19 | The symbol is a symmetric geometric figure with a central vertical oval, inward-pointing side triangles touching it, and a two-line rectangular cap at the top. |
| token_token_token_20 | The symbol has a large curved loop above two small face-like circles and a solid triangular base below, connected by short curved side links in a vertically aligned composition. |
