    "| token_token_token_10 | The symbol is a black, monochrome, digital drawing with a symmetrical structure. It consists of four thick, black, intersecting lines forming a cross-like shape. The lines are parallel and meet at a central point, creating four triangular sections. The lines are evenly spaced, with two lines running horizontally and two lines running vertically, forming a plus sign (+) shape. The intersections are precise and sharp, with no additional lines or shading. The background is white, providing a stark contrast to the black lines. The overall shape is geometric and angular, with clean, straight edges and no curves. The lines are of uniform thickness, and the symbol is centered within the frame. The style is minimalist and modern, with a focus on simplicity and clarity. There are no additional elements, textures, or colors, making the symbol easily recognizable and visually striking. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_11 | The symbol is a black, monochromatic, and bold graphic character that resembles an ampersand (&). The character is composed of four main strokes: a central vertical stroke, a curved loop-like stroke from the top left, a horizontal stroke intersecting the vertical near the middle, and a smaller loop-like stroke from the bottom left. The loops are open and do not close over themselves. The character is symmetric around the vertical stroke, with the two loops on either side being mirror images. The intersections between the strokes are precise and clean, creating a balanced and structured appearance. The black lines are thick and evenly spaced, giving the character a bold and prominent appearance against a white background. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_12 | The symbol consists of a black, stylized, cursive-like character with a symmetrical design. It features two main loops that intersect at the center. The upper loop is slightly larger and more open, while the lower loop is smaller and more closed. Both loops are connected by a short horizontal line that runs across the middle of the symbol. The overall shape resembles an abstract, elongated ampersand (&). The lines are thick and slightly uneven, giving the symbol a hand-drawn appearance. The upper loop is tilted slightly to the right, and the lower loop is tilted to the left, creating a sense of dynamic movement. The symbol has a monochromatic black color against a white background. The strokes are smooth but with subtle variations in thickness, adding a sense of texture. The loops and the horizontal line intersect precisely at the center, creating a balanced and harmonious composition. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_13 | The symbol is a black, abstract, geometric shape composed of intersecting lines and curves. The overall shape is symmetrical and resembles a stylized, abstract butterfly or star. The figure has a central, triangular area formed by two intersecting lines that curve outward, creating a V-shape. From each of the outer points of this V-shape, diagonal lines extend outward, creating a crisscross pattern. These diagonal lines intersect with additional lines that form a loop around the central triangular area, creating a looped, open shape at the bottom. The lines are thick and black, with sharp, clean edges, and there is no shading or texture. The background is white, making the black lines stand out prominently. The entire symbol is centered in the image, with a balanced and symmetrical structure. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_14 | The symbol is a black, monochromatic, abstract design on a white background. It consists of two large, oval-shaped loops that intersect at the top center, forming a symmetrical, butterfly-like structure. Below the loops, there are two straight lines that converge at the bottom center, creating a V-shape. The loops and straight lines are connected at their points of intersection, forming a cohesive, balanced shape. The design uses clean, continuous lines with no textures or gradients. The loops have a slightly thicker outline than the straight lines. The symbol is centered within the white background and has a minimalist, modern aesthetic focused on symmetry and geometric forms. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_15 | The symbol is a black, monochromatic, typographic character with a distinct, bold design. It features three horizontal lines intersecting with two vertical lines, creating a symmetrical, cross-like structure. The horizontal lines are thick and evenly spaced, while the vertical lines are thinner and positioned at the center of each horizontal line. The intersections form oval shapes above and below the center. The overall shape resembles an ampersand (&) with additional horizontal elements. The lines are precise and consistent in thickness, giving the symbol a clean, geometric appearance with a slightly three-dimensional feel. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_16 | The symbol is a black, monochromatic, highly stylized design rendered digitally. It combines curved and straight lines in a balanced, symmetrical composition. A central horizontal line runs across the middle, with two semi-circular loops above and below it. These loops are thick, smooth, and slightly three-dimensional in appearance. A diagonal vertical line intersects the horizontal line, positioned centrally between the loops. The entire symbol is outlined in thick black with no fill, standing out clearly against the white background. The style is modern, geometric, and minimalist, with an emphasis on clarity and structure. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_17 | The symbol consists of two overlapping semi-circular shapes that intersect at their centers. The top semi-circle is larger and slightly offset to the right, while the smaller one sits to the left. Both have thick black outlines with a slightly jagged, hand-drawn edge. A central horizontal line runs through the middle of the overlapping shapes, also thick and uneven. The background is white, creating strong contrast. The overall shape is symmetrical, with wavy lines adding a dynamic, hand-rendered quality. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_18 | The symbol is a monochromatic black-and-white abstract line drawing. It features a large circular head-like shape with a smooth outline and two darker circular features positioned symmetrically inside, resembling eyes or ears. From the bottom of the head, a straight line extends downward and splits into two smaller lines forming an X shape. The lines are thin, evenly spaced, and clean. The overall design is minimalistic and symmetrical, with a strong focus on simple geometric forms and balance. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_19 | The symbol is a monochrome geometric design with a symmetrical structure. A central vertical oval is flanked by two inward-pointing triangles whose bases touch the oval. At the top, two horizontal lines form a rectangular shape that connects with the triangles. The lines are thick, evenly spaced, and sharply defined. The design is sleek, modern, and minimalist, emphasizing geometric precision and symmetry against a white background. |\n",
    "| token_token_token_20 | The symbol consists of three primary black shapes arranged vertically. At the top is a large, elongated curved loop with a thick, slightly irregular outline. Beneath it are two small circular face-like shapes with single white eyes and subtle curved mouths. At the bottom is a large solid black triangular shape with a rounded base and pointed top. Short curved lines connect the faces to the triangle. The composition is symmetrical and vertically aligned, using thick black lines and strong contrast against a white background, combining abstract and figurative elements into a cohesive form. |\n",
